        <div id="parrots"><i class='fas fa-crow' style='font-size:68px;color:greenyellow'></i><p>Parrots are vibrant and intelligent birds belonging to the order Psittaciformes, comprising roughly 393 species. Renowned for their bright plumage, these birds exhibit a spectrum of colors including green, red, blue, and yellow. Parrots are highly social and vocal, often mimicking human speech and sounds, which highlights their advanced cognitive abilities. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, they thrive in diverse habitats from rainforests to savannas. Their strong, curved beaks and zygodactyl feet—two toes facing forward and two backward—are adept for climbing and handling food. Parrots primarily feed on seeds, nuts, fruit, and buds. Many species are known for their longevity, some living up to 80 years in captivity. Unfortunately, their popularity as pets and habitat destruction have led to many species being endangered. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of these captivating and ecologically important birds.</p></div>
        <div id="birds"><i class='fas fa-dove' style='font-size:68px;color:pink'></i><p>Doves are gentle, medium-sized birds belonging to the family Columbidae, which also includes pigeons. With around 300 species worldwide, doves are characterized by their slender bodies, short necks, and soft cooing calls. Their plumage varies from plain grays and browns to striking whites and iridescent hues, depending on the species. Doves are found in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, savannas, and urban areas, demonstrating remarkable adaptability. They primarily feed on seeds, fruits, and plants, foraging on the ground or in trees. Known for their monogamous pair bonds, doves often symbolize peace and love in various cultures. Their nests, typically flimsy structures made of twigs, house one to two eggs per clutch. Despite their widespread presence, some dove species face threats from habitat loss and hunting, necessitating conservation efforts to protect these serene and emblematic birds.

        <div id="eagles"><i class='fas fa-feather-alt' style='font-size:68px;color:brown'></i><p>Eagles are powerful, large birds of prey belonging to the family Accipitridae, encompassing over 60 species. Distinguished by their impressive size, keen eyesight, and formidable beaks, eagles are apex predators in their ecosystems. Their broad wings and strong talons enable them to soar at great heights and swiftly capture prey, which includes fish, mammals, and other birds. Eagles inhabit diverse environments ranging from mountains and forests to deserts and coastal regions. Species like the bald eagle and golden eagle are particularly well-known, with the former symbolizing freedom and strength in various cultures, especially in the United States. Eagles are known for their remarkable hunting skills and territorial nature, often building large nests, or eyries, high in trees or on cliffs. Conservation efforts are crucial for several eagle species, as they face threats from habitat destruction, pollution, and human activities, which have led to declining populations in some regions.</p></div>
